![Design preview for the Note App](Preview.PNG)

NoteIt - A Note Taking App that allows users to add, edit, and delete notes, storing them in the browser's localStorage for persistence across sessions. The interface includes an input field, an "Add Note" button, and a list displaying notes with "Edit" and "Delete" buttons. Each note is assigned a random background color from a predefined array, which is also stored in localStorage. Additionally, the navbar features a 'Your Notes' link that directs users to the section where notes are displayed, ensuring a seamless user experience and data retention even after refreshing or closing the browser.
